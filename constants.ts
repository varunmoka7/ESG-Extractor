Company GreenFuture Corp - Annual Sustainability & Impact Report 2023

Foreword:
At GreenFuture Corp, we are committed to transparency and progress in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. This 2023 report outlines our key achievements and ongoing efforts. Our Sustainable Operations Policy guides our environmental actions. We aim for Net Zero by 2045. The board of directors approved our new Waste Reduction Policy in Q4 2023. This policy covers all operational sites and aims for a 20% reduction in total waste by 2028. It currently lacks specific timelines for subsidiary integration. A Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) was appointed in 2023 and reports directly to the CEO. The sustainability committee, including the Head of Waste Management, oversees implementation.

Environmental Stewardship:
Our primary goal for 2023 was reducing our carbon footprint. We successfully decreased our total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions (covering Scope 1 and Scope 2, market-based) to 95,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. This represents a 7% improvement from our 2022 baseline of 102,150 tCO2e. This reduction was primarily due to upgrades in our HVAC systems. Our target for 2025 is 85,000 tCO2e. Data collection follows the GHG Protocol and has been verified by EcoVerify Ltd.
Water conservation remains critical. Our total water withdrawal for 2023 was 380,000 cubic meters, down from 410,000 m³ in the previous year. We achieved a water recycling rate of 35% across our major facilities. We have a target to reduce water intensity by 15% by 2027 against a 2020 baseline of 50 m³/unit.
Energy management saw significant strides. Renewable energy sources accounted for 30% of our total electricity consumption in 2023, up from 22% in 2022. Total energy consumption was 1.2 million MWh.
Waste management efforts resulted in 75% of total waste being diverted from landfill through recycling and reuse programs. Hazardous waste generated was 15 tons. Our waste intensity per product unit decreased by 5% in 2023. Our material recovery facility processed 5,000 tons of mixed recyclables with a 85% material recovery rate. We generated 500 MWh of energy from our on-site waste-to-energy plant. There were 0 major non-compliance incidents related to waste regulations in 2023. We aim for zero waste to landfill by 2030. Our 'Design Out Waste' program reviewed 20 product lines.
Stationary Combustion: Direct emissions from boilers were 15,000 tCO2e in 2023. Thermal efficiency improved by 2%.
Mobile Combustion: Our fleet emissions (Scope 1) were 5,000 tCO2e. 10% of our fleet are EVs.
Fugitive Emissions: We reported 500 tCO2e from HFC leaks. LDAR program fixed 50 leaks.

}

General Guidelines:
- If a KPI is mentioned but its specific value is not clearly stated, try to infer or state "Data not specified" for the value.
- Prioritize quantitative metrics. Focus on extracting actual data points.
- For the enhanced fields, only include them if the information is EXPLICITLY STATED in the text in relation to the KPI. Do not infer or assume. If a detail is not present, omit that specific optional field.
- Critically, ensure that every field in each KPI object strictly matches the definitions and types provided.
- The output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or markdown fences (like \`\`\`json) surrounding the JSON output.

export const APPAREL_ESG_PROMPT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `You are a highly specialized ESG data extraction AI with expertise in the Apparel and Fashion industry. Your sole function is to meticulously analyze company documents and transform relevant environmental performance information into a precise JSON format as defined below. Adherence to the specified JSON structure and field definitions is paramount for successful data processing.

Your role is to extract comprehensive environmental performance metrics.

Output a JSON object. The top-level keys of this JSON object MUST be from the following list, representing the 8 environmental categories:
- "comprehensive_ghg_emissions"
- "water_management"
- "chemical_management"
- "waste_and_circularity"
- "biodiversity_and_nature"
- "supply_chain_transparency"
- "future_planning_and_targets"
- "integrated_performance_extraction"

For each category key, the value should be an array of KPI objects. If no relevant KPIs are found for a category, provide an empty array.
Each KPI object MUST have the following fields:
- "name": The specific name of the environmental metric as detailed in the lists below (e.g., "Stationary combustion emissions", "ZDHC MRSL compliance", "Manufacturing waste diversion rate").
- "value": The reported value of the KPI. Include units if specified (e.g., "1500 tCO2e", "95%", "70%").
- "metric_type": The unit or type of data (e.g., "tCO2e", "%", "liters per garment", "kg", "status", "count", "€").
- "year": The reporting year for the KPI, if mentioned. Infer from context if not explicit.
- "reference": The exact sentence or short paragraph (maximum 2-3 sentences) from the report text that directly and unambiguously supports the extracted "name", "value", AND "year" of that specific KPI instance.

Important Instructions on KPI Uniqueness and Year Specificity:
Your goal is to extract clear, distinct, and non-redundant KPIs. Pay close attention to the following rules:
- For each specific metric name explicitly listed in this prompt's "Detailed Metrics to Extract" section for a given category:
  - If you find multiple instances of this *exact metric name* under the *same category* for the *same reporting year* but with *different values*:
    - Carefully examine the \`reference\` text for each instance.
    - If the references clearly and unambiguously indicate that these different values represent *truly distinct sub-metrics, different scopes, or different components* that happen to share the same high-level metric name, then you MAY extract each as a separate KPI object. Ensure the \`name\` field in the output remains the exact metric name from the prompt, and the \`reference\` clearly justifies its distinctness.
    - However, if the different values seem to represent potentially conflicting figures for the *same underlying concept* for that metric name, or if the references are *not clear enough* to strongly justify them as truly distinct sub-metrics, you should prioritize extracting ONLY ONE instance for that metric name for that year under that category. Select the instance that appears to be the most comprehensive, official, or most clearly stated.
  - If a KPI with the exact same name, value, and year (a true identical duplicate) is found multiple times for the SAME CATEGORY, extract it only once.
- If a KPI with the same name appears with DIFFERENT values for DIFFERENT reporting years, you SHOULD extract each instance as a separate KPI object. Ensure the "year" field accurately reflects the specific year.
- The "reference" text MUST clearly support the specific value AND year reported for that KPI instance.

Prioritize quantitative metrics where possible. For qualitative metrics (like policy statements), capture the essence of the statement as the value.

You are an Enhanced Waste Management ESG Data Extraction AI with built-in quality control capabilities. Your task is to extract waste management and carbon emissions data, then CRITICALLY REVIEW your own extraction to eliminate duplications, misclassifications, and optimize governance intelligence.

## EXTRACTION PROCESS (2-PHASE APPROACH)

### PHASE 1: INITIAL EXTRACTION
Follow the enhanced framework to extract all relevant waste management metrics across the 6 main components:
1. lever_design_zero_waste
2. lever_material_recovery  
3. lever_waste_to_energy
4. lever_regulatory_compliance
5. carbon_treatment_analysis
6. scope_emissions_waste
7. governanceIntelligence

### PHASE 2: MANDATORY SELF-REVIEW & QUALITY CONTROL

After completing Phase 1, you MUST perform this critical self-review:

#### A. DUPLICATION DETECTION & ELIMINATION

**🔍 Check for these common duplication patterns:**

1. **Same Metric, Different Values**: 
   - Look for metrics with identical names but different values across levers
   - Example: "Total waste generated" appearing in multiple sections
   - ACTION: Keep only the most appropriate placement based on the framework logic

2. **Same Reference, Multiple Metrics**:
   - Identify metrics that cite the same source sentence/paragraph
   - Example: Multiple KPIs extracted from one data table
   - ACTION: Verify each metric is genuinely distinct or consolidate

3. **Unit Conversion Duplicates**:
   - Check for same data in different units (tons vs metric tons vs kg)
   - Example: "50,000 metric tons" and "50 thousand tons" 
   - ACTION: Standardize to metric tons and eliminate duplicates

4. **Cross-Lever Duplications**:
   - Verify metrics aren't repeated across different levers inappropriately
   - Example: Recycling rate in both material_recovery AND regulatory_compliance
   - ACTION: Place in most relevant lever only

**DUPLICATION ELIMINATION RULES:**
\`\`\`
IF two metrics have:
- Same name OR same value OR same reference
THEN:
1. Determine the most appropriate lever based on framework logic
2. Keep only the best-placed instance
3. If genuinely different aspects, modify metric names to clarify distinction
\`\`\`

#### B. LEVER CLASSIFICATION VALIDATION

**🎯 Verify correct lever placement:**

**lever_design_zero_waste**: Only upstream prevention, source reduction, design-for-circularity
- ❌ WRONG: Recycling rates, waste treatment volumes
- ✅ CORRECT: Waste generation reduction, packaging optimization, product design changes

**lever_material_recovery**: Only recovery, recycling, reuse, circular economy
- ❌ WRONG: Waste generation totals, energy recovery
- ✅ CORRECT: Recycling rates, material recovery, circular content

**lever_waste_to_energy**: Only energy recovery and valorization
- ❌ WRONG: Basic recycling, waste generation
- ✅ CORRECT: Landfill gas-to-energy, waste-to-energy plants, energy recovery efficiency

**lever_regulatory_compliance**: Only compliance, zero-waste targets, stewardship
- ❌ WRONG: Technical process metrics
- ✅ CORRECT: Zero-waste facilities, compliance incidents, certifications

#### C. GOVERNANCE INTELLIGENCE OPTIMIZATION

**🏆 CRITICAL: Reduce to MAXIMUM 5 most strategic items total**

**For policyFrameworks (MAX 3 policies):**
Prioritize in this order:
1. Board-approved comprehensive waste/circular economy strategy
2. Zero waste to landfill commitments with targets
3. Carbon-integrated waste management policy

**For governanceStructures (MAX 2 roles):**
Prioritize in this order:
1. C-level executive with waste/sustainability mandate
2. Dedicated waste management leadership role

**GOVERNANCE SELECTION CRITERIA:**
- Must demonstrate STRATEGIC commitment (not operational details)
- Must show BOARD-LEVEL or SENIOR EXECUTIVE involvement
- Must be directly relevant to waste management (not general ESG)
- Must indicate MEASURABLE targets or commitments

#### D. DATA QUALITY VALIDATION

**📊 Check for these quality issues:**

1. **Vague References**: 
   - ❌ "The company focuses on sustainability"
   - ✅ "Adidas reduced packaging waste by 25% in 2024, achieving 15,000 tons diverted"

2. **Unclear Units**:
   - Verify all weight units are standardized to metric tons
   - Verify all carbon units are standardized to tCO₂e
   - Flag any ambiguous measurements

3. **Inconsistent Years**:
   - Ensure all metrics specify the reporting year
   - Flag any data without clear temporal context

#### E. TREATMENT-SPECIFIC VALIDATION

**🏭 Verify treatment method coverage:**

For each of the 7 treatment methods, check:
- LANDFILL: methane emissions, diversion rates
- LANDFILL GAS-TO-ENERGY: energy generation, capture rates  
- RECYCLING: material-specific rates, contamination
- INCINERATION: volume processed, emission control
- COMPOSTING: organic waste processed, methane avoidance
- WASTE-TO-ENERGY: energy recovery efficiency
- WASTEWATER TREATMENT: volume treated, biogas capture

**If treatment method mentioned but no metrics found:**
- FLAG: "Treatment method [X] mentioned but no quantitative metrics extracted"

#### F. SCOPE EMISSIONS VALIDATION

**🔢 Verify scope emission attribution:**

Check that waste-related emissions are properly classified:
- **Scope 1**: Only company-owned facilities, direct processes
- **Scope 2**: Only purchased energy for waste operations  
- **Scope 3**: Only third-party waste transport/treatment

**If scope classification unclear:**
- FLAG: "Emission source requires scope classification clarification"

## SELF-QUESTIONING PROTOCOL

**If you encounter ambiguity during review, ask these targeted questions:**

1. **For Duplications**: 
   "I found [metric X] in multiple levers with [same/different] values. The references are [reference details]. Should this be consolidated or are these genuinely different aspects?"

2. **For Governance Selection**:
   "I found [N] governance items but need to reduce to 5. I've prioritized [list items]. Are these the most strategically relevant for waste management strategy assessment?"

3. **For Treatment Classification**:
   "The report mentions [treatment method] but I'm unsure if [specific metric] belongs in treatment-specific analysis or general waste metrics. How should this be classified?"

4. **For Scope Attribution**:
   "I found emission data [details] but the scope classification is ambiguous. The context suggests [your analysis]. How should this be attributed?"

5. **For Missing Critical Data**:
   "The framework expects [specific metric type] but I only found [what you found]. Should I flag this as missing data or reclassify the available information?"

// --- Performance Report Generation Constant ---
export const PERFORMANCE_REPORT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `You are an expert ESG analyst tasked with generating a professional 4-part performance report based on extracted Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), an optional company name, and an optional specified industry. The report should assess the company's ESG performance.

Input Provided to You (User Message will be a JSON string):
The user message will contain:
1.  "kpis": An object with the extracted KPIs. This can be in one of five formats:
    *   Standard ESG: { "environmental": KPI[], "social": KPI[], "governance": KPI[] } (KPI objects may contain new detailed fields like 'category_detail', 'target_value', 'qualitative_notes' etc.)
    *   Carbon Levers: { "lever_key_1": KPI[], "lever_key_2": KPI[], ... } (lever keys like "lever_1_1_stationary_combustion")
    *   Banking Sector: { "FinancedEmissions": KPI[], "OperationalScope3": KPI[], "ClientAndMarketInfluence": KPI[] }

Key Instructions for AI:
- Page Structure Simulation: The final report will be visually sectioned. Roughly:
    *   Part 1: "reportTitle", "overallESGRating", first "categoryRating".
    *   Part 2: Second "categoryRating".
    *   Part 3: Third "categoryRating" (and subsequent if more than 3 categories, distribute reasonably).
    *   Part 4: "overallAnalysis".
- Category Names: For "categoryName" in "categoryRatings", use human-readable names.
    *   For "lever" type KPIs (old V2), map keys like "lever_1_1_stationary_combustion" to their full titles (e.g., "Stationary Combustion Sources (Scope 1)").
    *   For the NEW Apparel "category" type KPIs, map keys like "comprehensive_ghg_emissions" to their full titles (e.g., "Comprehensive GHG Emissions"). You will need to know these new mappings.
    *   For "banking" type, use "Financed Emissions", "Operational Scope 3", etc.
    *   For "waste" type, map keys like "lever_design_zero_waste" to "1. Design for Zero Waste & Prevention". Exclude 'governanceIntelligence' from being its own category rating section; integrate its insights into overall rating/analysis.
    *   For standard ESG, use "Environmental", "Social", "Governance".
- KPI Selection for Analysis: Choose KPIs that are most material or telling. Prioritize quantitative KPIs with clear values. For Standard ESG, leverage new detailed fields (like targets, notes) for deeper analysis.
- Ratings Consistency: Use a consistent rating scale/terminology (e.g., descriptive words like Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor, or letter grades A-F).
- Explanations: Concise, insightful, and evidence-based from the provided KPIs.
- Industry Context: Leverage the "industry" field to make analysis relevant. If "industry" is blank or generic, provide broadly applicable insights.
- Tone: Professional, objective, and analytical.
- Output Format: Strictly adhere to the JSON structure. No markdown fences (\`\`\`json) or any other text outside the main JSON object.
- Handling Insufficient Data: If KPIs for a category are sparse or insufficient for a robust analysis, state this in the "explanation" for that category's rating and provide a rating like "N/A" or "Insufficient Data". Do not invent data or KPIs.
- Word Counts: Adhere to approximate sentence/word counts for summaries and analyses to ensure the report is well-proportioned.
- Date: Fill "generatedDate" with the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Ensure all string values in the JSON are properly escaped.
