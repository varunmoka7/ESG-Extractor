# ESG Extractor AI Engine Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the Phase 1 enhancements implemented to improve the ESG Metrics Extractor's AI processing engine.

## Phase 1A: Enhanced Prompt Engineering ✅ COMPLETED

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning
- **Implementation**: Added step-by-step processing methodology to all prompts
- **Benefit**: Improves AI reasoning and reduces errors
- **Example**:
```
Think step by step:
1. Initial Scan: Identify all potential ESG metrics in the text
2. Validation: Check units, ranges, and temporal consistency
3. Confidence Assessment: Score each metric based on evidence quality
4. Quality Control: Flag issues and uncertainties
5. Final Output: Structured JSON with comprehensive metadata
```

#### 2. Role-Based Prompting
- **Implementation**: Defined specific roles for each extractor type
- **Benefit**: Leverages AI's understanding of domain expertise
- **Examples**:
- Standard: "ESG Data Quality Specialist with 10+ years of experience"
- Banking: "Expertise in Banking Sector decarbonization frameworks and PCAF standards"
- Apparel: "Expertise in Apparel and Fashion industry sustainability standards"

#### 3. Few-Shot Learning
- **Implementation**: Added concrete examples of high vs low confidence extractions
- **Benefit**: Teaches AI to recognize quality patterns
- **Example**:
```
Example 1 (High Confidence - 95):
Input: "Our CO2 emissions were 50,000 metric tons in 2023"
Output: {"confidence_score": 95, "confidence_reasoning": "Clear metric with specific number, units, and year"}

Example 2 (Low Confidence - 30):
Input: "We reduced emissions significantly"
Output: {"confidence_score": 30, "confidence_reasoning": "Vague description without specific numbers or units"}
```

#### 4. Constraint-Based Prompting
- **Implementation**: Added critical constraints and validation rules
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistent output quality
- **Constraints**:
- Every KPI MUST have a confidence score (0-100)
- Confidence scores below 70 MUST include reasoning
- All values MUST have appropriate units
- Years MUST be consistent across related metrics

## Phase 1B: Confidence Scoring System ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Details

#### Confidence Score Calculation
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Factors**:
  - Specific numeric values (+20 points)
  - Appropriate units (+15 points)
  - Year specification (+10 points)
  - Detailed reference (+5 points)

#### Confidence Levels
- **90-100**: Clear, specific metric with exact numbers, units, and year
- **70-89**: Clear metric with approximate numbers or inferred units
- **50-69**: Metric identified but with some ambiguity
- **30-49**: Potential metric with significant uncertainty
- **0-29**: Very uncertain extraction

#### Enhanced KPI Structure
```json
{
  "name": "Total GHG Emissions Scope 1 & 2",
  "value": "95,000",
  "metric_type": "metric tons of CO2 equivalent",
  "year": 2023,
  "reference": "Our total greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 95,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.",
  "confidence_score": 95,
  "confidence_reasoning": "Clear metric with specific number, units, and year",
  "quality_flags": [],
  "validation_status": "valid"
}
```

## Phase 1C: Error Handling & Retry Logic ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Details

#### Robust AI Generation
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with different models
- **Model Fallback**: gemini-1.5-pro → gemini-pro → fallback response
- **Response Validation**: Quality checks before accepting results

#### Error Handling Features
- **Input Validation**: Checks for required fields
- **Response Quality Validation**: Ensures valid JSON structure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses when AI fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Error tracking and debugging

#### Validation Functions
- **Unit Validation**: Checks if units are appropriate for category
- **Range Validation**: Ensures values are within reasonable ranges
- **Temporal Consistency**: Validates year consistency across metrics
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and flags duplicate metrics
